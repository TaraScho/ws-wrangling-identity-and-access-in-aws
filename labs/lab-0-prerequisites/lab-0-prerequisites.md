# Lab 0 - Prerequisites: Setup and Validation

**Duration:** 10 minutes

## Overview

Configure your AWS credentials, clone the workshop repository, and run the setup script. The script handles everything else — tool installation, infrastructure deployment, and exercise profile configuration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Never deploy lab resources in a production AWS account. This lab intentionally deploys vulnerable resources that create serious privilege escalation paths in your AWS account.
